# Dwemer Hacker US Patch


## Installation

1) Make sure you have a working Ultimate Skyrim install. 
2) Install [Dwemer Hacker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80660)
3) Place the ESP before Requiem.esp, left pane doesn't matter.
4) Install Dwemer Hacker - US Patch from Github

6) Re-run Reqtificator

While it should work without the patch, I forward the Allow Pickpocketing record to the Drawven Race Records for Spiders, Constructs, Ballista, and Centurions to ensure it works properly (I think without that the text for Hacking won't pop up).

Default Lock Picking lvls are

- Dwarven Spider: 50 (Adept)
- Dwarven Spheres: 75 (Expert)
- Dwarven Ballista: 75 (Expert)
- Dwarven Centurion: 100 (Master)

Considering moving each down by 25 as they're tougher to begin with in Requiem.

## Known Issues

With how the original mod does its job, the lockpicking minigame bypasses Requiems expertise system and basically reverts it to vanilla (you can pick a Centurion with 0 perks and low skill for example). Working on trying to figure that out.
